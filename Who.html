		Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs)<br>

PLBs transmit personalized distress signals in the 406 MHz spectrum range and aid in search and rescue missions.<br><br>

<b>How does it work?</b><br>

A personal locator beacon has a single purpose - to alert authorities that you need help immediately. The distress signal on a PLB is designed to be easily activated by a person also in a dangerous situation.<br>
<ul>
	<li>Step 1: Activating a PLB.</li>

	<li>Step 2: Distress signal is sent to a satellite. When you activate a PLB, it sends out two signals - a powerful digital signal at 406 MHz that is received by the COSPAS-SARSAT international search and rescue satellite system and a low-power analog honing signal at 121.5MHz. If the PLB has GPS, then the 406 MHz distress signal will contain location coordinates that can be used to start a rescue effort as soon as the alert is received.</li><br>

			<b>What is a Personal Locator Beacon (PLB)?</b><br>
		A Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) is a handheld device that is used to alert search and rescue authorities in the event of an emergency. It is designed to be carried by individuals and activated manually in an emergency situation. PLBs are typically small and lightweight, making them easy to carry on outdoor adventures like hiking, camping, and boating. When activated, a PLB sends out a signal to a network of satellites, which then transmit the distress signal to rescue authorities.<br><br>

		The dimensions of a PLB can vary depending on the model and manufacturer. However, most PLBs are relatively small and compact, typically measuring around 4-5 inches in length, 2-3 inches in width, and 1-2 inches in thickness.
